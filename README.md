# trueslots

Hey, this is so funny game - slot machine! Yeah, it's true.

### How does it work?

It's pretty simple, to run it, you need to clone this repository. After that, install all the necessary nmp packages `npm install` and preferably have [ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/index.html) on hand as a local blockchain.

To start this game, you need to first open ganache, so make a `truffle migrate` so that your smart contract is embedded in the blockchain, after which `npm run dev` and you can enjoy playing slots.

Also, do not forget that you will need to import the wallet (the one in ganache) into MetaMask and configure it on localhost â€“ I think you can safely Google it on the Internet.

### How can I help the project?

Now there is not enough UI and I don't fully like the logic of the smart contract, if you want to help with this, then just send pull requests and let's make the coolest slot game!
